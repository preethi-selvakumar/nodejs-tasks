Task 9 Input File

This file is created to test backpressure handling in Node.js streams.
Backpressure occurs when the writable stream cannot handle the incoming
data as fast as the readable stream is sending it.

By implementing flow control, we can pause the readable stream when
the writable stream buffer is full and resume it when the buffer drains.

This prevents memory overflow and ensures smooth data transfer.

Node.js makes it simple to implement backpressure using pause(),
resume(), and the drain event.
