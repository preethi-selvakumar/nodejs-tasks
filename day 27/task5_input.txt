Task 5 Input File

This file is created to test reading large files using Node.js streams.
We want to calculate how many total bytes are read while processing this file.

Streams are memory efficient because they process data chunk by chunk
instead of loading the entire file into memory at once.
This is especially useful when working with very large files like logs,
videos, or data exports.

By reading this file with a readable stream, we can measure
the total number of bytes transferred from disk to our program.
This is a basic but powerful demonstration of how streams
can help us handle large amounts of data efficiently.
